            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2020, Dog Lovers began as a small community of passionate dog enthusiasts who wanted to create a space where fellow dog owners could connect, learn, and share their experiences. What started as a local meetup group has grown into a thriving online and offline community dedicated to promoting responsible dog ownership and celebrating the joy that dogs bring to our lives.</p>
